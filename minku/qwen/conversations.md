# Qwen Model Conversations

The following links document three attempts using Qwen3-235B-A22B-2507 with thinking disabled to solve the "Binary Signal Restoration" problem. Each attempt fails on at least one test case due to incorrect handling of constraints or edge cases.

- **Run 01**: [Link placeholder]  
  - Attempt: Greedy approach, flipping bits based on local optimization.
  - Failure: Fails on test case 4 (tricky case with long sequences of identical bits).
- **Run 02**: [Link placeholder]  
  - Attempt: Simple DP without considering consecutive bit constraints.
  - Failure: Fails on test case 3 (maximum constraints with large k).
- **Run 03**: [Link placeholder]  
  - Attempt: Incorrect bit manipulation for state transitions.
  - Failure: Fails on test case 2 (minimum constraints with small n).
