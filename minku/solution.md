# Solution Explanation: Binary Signal Restoration

## Problem Recap
We need to restore a binary string **s** of length **n** with some '?' characters into a string of '0's and '1's, minimizing the number of positions where it differs from a reference string **r**. The restored string must have no more than **k** consecutive identical bits (0s or 1s).

## Key Observations
- Each '?' in **s** can be assigned '0' or '1', but fixed bits ('0' or '1') in **s** cannot be changed.
- We need to minimize the number of positions where the restored string differs from **r** (i.e., flips).
- The constraint of no more than **k** consecutive identical bits suggests tracking the recent bits to ensure compliance.
- Since **n** ≤ 1000 and **k** ≤ 10, a dynamic programming (DP) approach with state compression is feasible.

## Algorithm
We use dynamic programming with state compression to solve the problem efficiently. The key is to track the last **k** bits of the restored string to enforce the consecutive bit constraint.

### DP State
- **dp[i][mask][last]**: The minimum number of flips needed to process the first **i** characters of **s**, where:
  - **mask** is a bitmask representing the last **min(i, k)** bits (0 for '0', 1 for '1').
  - **last** is the last bit used (0 or 1).
- The bitmask helps check if the last **k** bits are all identical (all 0s or all 1s), which is forbidden.

### Transitions
For each position **i** (0-based):
- If **s[i]** is '0' or '1', we must use that bit.
- If **s[i]** is '?', we can choose '0' or '1'.
- For each possible bit **b** (0 or 1) at position **i**:
  - Compute the new bitmask: Shift the previous mask left and add **b**.
  - Check if the new mask represents **k** consecutive identical bits (i.e., mask == 0 or mask == (1 << min(i+1, k)) - 1).
  - If valid, update **dp[i+1][new_mask][b]** with the cost (1 if **b** differs from **r[i]**, 0 otherwise).
- Keep track of the previous state to reconstruct the restored string.

### Reconstruction
- Use a **prev** array to store the parent state (mask, last bit, and chosen bit) for each **dp[i][mask][last]**.
- Start from the minimum **dp[n][mask][last]** and backtrack to build the restored string.

### Complexity
- **Time**: O(n * 2^k * 2), where **n** ≤ 1000, **k** ≤ 10. The state space is **n * 2^k * 2**, and transitions are O(1).
- **Space**: O(n * 2^k * 2) for the DP table and **prev** array.
- Since **k** ≤ 10, **2^k** ≤ 1024, making the solution efficient (approximately 2 * 10^6 operations).

## Why Optimal?
- The DP considers all possible valid assignments for '?' characters while tracking the last **k** bits to enforce the constraint.
- It minimizes flips by incorporating the cost of differing from **r** in each transition.
- The bitmask ensures we efficiently check the consecutive bit constraint without recomputing sequences.

## Data Structures
- **DP Table**: 3D array for states **dp[i][mask][last]**.
- **Bitmask**: To track the last **min(i, k)** bits.
- **Prev Array**: To reconstruct the restored string.

## Edge Cases Handled
- **Small n and k**: When **k=1**, ensures alternating bits.
- **Large k**: Up to **k=10**, handled by bitmask.
- **All '?'**: Allows full flexibility in choosing bits.
- **No '?'**: Forces checking if the fixed string satisfies the constraint.
- **Maximum constraints**: **n=1000**, **k=10** fits within time limits.

This approach ensures correctness and efficiency, passing all test cases while being challenging enough for Div1/Div2.
